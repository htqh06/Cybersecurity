# the Three main aspects of the model based security testing
## Security Properties
Security Properties: These are models of security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization or non-repudiation.
## Vulnerabilities:
Vulnerabilities: These are models of characteristics of a system without which a specified class of security breaches would not be possible. Vulnerabilities can be described similar to how faults are described by fault models, usually as a deviation from a correct programme or system. Examples for models of vulnerabilities include security mutation operators.
## Functionality of Security Mechanisms
 Functionality of Security Mechanisms: These are models of functional security measures such as access control or usage control means. The model here usually is provided by the policy that configures the respective mechanism

## The main purpose this part will do:
1. define the key security properties. 
2. describe the security properties in formal languages.
3. build the connection between these security properties and the model, which means the change of the safe state to some unsafe state based on the security properties.
